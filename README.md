# Genetic_optimization_on_Potential_Parameter
A tutorial / instructional code I developed for a summer project for undergrad students. They used genetic optimization on the physical parameters of an effective interparticle potential, developed by Sam (postdoc) in our group, to fit the binding/dissociation rate of a coarse-grained DNA hinge to the real experimental data
